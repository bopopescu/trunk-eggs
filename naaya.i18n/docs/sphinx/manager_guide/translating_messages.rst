Translating messages
====================

The translation web interface is available in Naaya Administration,
Translate Messages link in Administration panel. It provides two pages,
accessible by top tabs:
* Messages
* Import/Export

Messages tab
------------
You can browse the messages or search for a specific string. For each
language besides English a column is provided, with a check mark that
indicates an existing translation. Number of untranslated messages in
each language is also displayed next to the column name.

You can enter a translation by clicking the message and editing
the corresponding text box. There is also a suggestion beneath the box
which you can use as a starting point for your translation by clicking it.

Import/Export tab
-----------------
Here you may export the translation database in various formats. One common
way to handle translations is downloading a .PO translation file, editing
it accordingly and uploading the new version in the portal.

Translating objects
-------------------
Most of the content objects (documents, news, any publishable information)
provide a multi-lingual editor in editing interface.
You can choose to copy the content from a given language in order to have a
starting point for your translation. Remember that if the object can not provide
content in a requested language (no translation entered),
the object will be shown in the default language in portal.
If, however, the object is neither available in default language,
the user will see a dialog that suggests him the available languages
for the content. E.g.: `item only translated in *Dutch*`.
