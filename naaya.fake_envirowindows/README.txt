FakeEnviroWindows - a replacement for EnviroWindows that uses Naaya instead
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid having to migrate content from one type of website to another,
we have a EnviroWindowsSite class that inherits from NySite. This way the
old envirowindows site will have all Naaya behaviour with minimum migration
required.
