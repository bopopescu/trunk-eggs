Portlets
========

Portlets represent pieces of content that help make up the pages in a Naaya
site. They show up at the left or right side of the main content, or just below
it. Portlets can be assigned to any folder or content item, and may or may not
be inherited by subobjects.

Portlets are part of :ref:`portlets_tool` and can be managed either from
:term:`ZMI` or from the :ref:`administration section`
