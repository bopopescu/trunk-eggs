Content types
=============

  * Information about what are content types.
  
When you have a piece of information that you want to see published in the portal, the first step is to decide what type of content would better accommodate it. It is important to put the data in the right format because each type of content has a different set of attributes which can later be used to correctly index and categorise it.

All types of content have a common set of attributes that generically describe resources. They are called metadata. Since fully defining a resource implies generically describing it and also describing its custom characteristics, all Naaya content types have:
	* a common set of properties (e.g. title, description, release date, contributor)
	* a custom set of properties (e.g. *location* for *events*, *expiration date* for *news*)

Administrators can view and configure all these attributes, or properties, in the *Administration area*, *Manage content types*. It is also here that they can decide whether the content types available in the portal can be geo-tagged or ratable. Depending on the setup chosen by administrators – in terms of geo-taggable content types – such content types can be geotagged by users. 

When creating or editing a content type, users can feel in a description of the content type by means of an easy to use, WYSIWYG web editor.


What content types are available? 

* Folder
	Folders are containers of information, similar to the ones found in operating systems. They have metadata attached, in order to help describe and index the data inside them.
* File
	A standard file, briefly described by its metadata. The file types (PDF, Word, PPT) are automatically recognised by the system in most cases and the corresponding icon appears next to them. It is possible to keep old versions of Naaya files for user consultation.
* HTML document
	You can use this content type to build a generic Web page. The user-friendly integrated web editor will help you compose the pages, without having to actually write HTML code. 
* Media file
	When you need to display films, presentations, audio tracks or other multimedia materials inside the portal pages, you can use this content type to upload the film file in any format.
* News
	The news item is a short piece of information with a limited duration of life. It is very simple to display news from remote sources of information in the portal pages and also to allow other websites to pick up the latest news from Naaya portals.
* Event
	This content type stores information about an event, a meeting, a conference, etc. The events are syndicated by default and can be shown under the form of an events calendar. The RDF calendar can expose events from various sources of information, including the local portal.
* Story
	The story is somewhat similar to the news, but with an unlimited period of relevancy. Stories can contain a longer body, have pictures inserted in them and a small image to be displayed on the front page if necessary.
* URL
	URL objects contain links to remote pages. They are easy to check at regular intervals using an automatic link checker and can be described by the metadata.
* Geo Point
	This content type stores data about certain locations, which are then shown on an interactive map.
* Pointer
	Pointers are links to internal portal pages. When adding a pointer, a sitemap is displayed to pick from. 
* Organisation
	It is a geo-tagged object that displays organisation-related data, providing contact details and description, and is dynamically linked with two other content types: Experts and Projects.
* Expert
	The Expert content type displays information about experts, providing, aside from detailed contacts – e-mail address, phone, mobile phone, web page, instant messaging ID, the expert's main (and secondary) area of expertise and his/her working language(s), as well as the possibility to upload a photo and the expert's CV. 
* Project
	This content type stores data about projects, is dynamically linked with Organisations and is a geo-tagged object.
* Edu Product
	EduProduct is a complex geo-tagged content type, which exposes educational events, products ad websites.

How to create content types?

After having chosen the location where you want to create a content type, and after having chosen the content type you want to create, there is a sequence of steps you need to follow: 
go to a folder->choose on the right of *Submit* the content type you want to create->fill in the form that opens with: Title, Description, geographical coverage, keywords, sort order, release date, choose whether the object is *open for comments* or not, maintainer email, etc. When you've filled in the requested information, you can push the *Submit* button, to save the information. Once created the content type, you can go back to edit it.
