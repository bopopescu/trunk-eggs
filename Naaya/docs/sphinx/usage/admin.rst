Some general considerations about the administration section. 


The Administration area (Portal administration centre) is provided to facilitate users with the
role of administrator to make basic maintenance operations and customisations of their portal. 
Administrators are intended to be users with full decisional rights over the content and presentation 
of the portal.

After logging in with the proper right, you can reach the Administration area by selecting the 
Administration option from the top services links list. In here, all functionalities are listed in
the right-side Administration portlet.

* Add some reference to the roles document (and tell people that they need an admin account to use the admin).
* Describe here a few words about all administration sections.

The portal administration area contains a set of forms for:
