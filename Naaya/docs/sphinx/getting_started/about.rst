About Naaya
===========

Naaya was originally developed by Fiensiel, Romania. (some history here?)

Releases
--------

*Naaya* has a release cycle of a month. Every month we release a new stable
version. For example *2.11.03* means that the major version of Naaya is *2*
the year of the release is *2011* and the *03* is the month.

The decision behind this is that we update *Naaya* very often an there aren't
really many major releases making the update cycle smoother.

What would count as a major release is the switch to a newer version of Zope2
or other major changes that will possibly break old code.


Is Naaya for me?
----------------

If you need a solid CMS based on Zope2...
